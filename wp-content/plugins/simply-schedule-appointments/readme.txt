Simply Schedule Appointments is perfect if you want to let your customers schedule phone calls, in-person or virtual video meetings, or coaching appointments.

You can tame your schedule and easily manage when you're available for bookings. And block off dates when you don't want to be disturbed for bookings — no more phone calls or back-and-forth emails to find a meeting time that works.

Easily limit how many daily appointments you schedule and set the minimum time between bookings. Take control of your booking calendars and meetings.

Offer different types of appointment calendars for your services. For example, you could allow new clients to schedule on an intro call calendar or let established customers schedule a longer booking with a separate calendar.

Are you looking to offer tutoring or remote teaching classes? Let your students quickly book times with you. Localized time zones make meetings for distance learning and remote office hours simple to schedule.

Simply Schedule Appointments contains all your data about your appointments and customers on your WordPress site. Again, you'll be able to own your data since we don't connect out to a third-party appointments service.

And our UI is snappy, highly responsive, and a joy to use.

= Flexible, Fast, and Powerful Booking Calendars =

Other appointment scheduling plugins are either too simple or too complicated. They lack the basic features you need and want to start booking, or, if they do have those features, as you grow and add services, staff, and locations, they become complex and confusing to use for booking.

Simply Schedule Appointments is ready to grow with your business' booking needs — without all the confusion and clutter of settings that don't apply to you.

Simply Schedule Appointments offers fully responsive booking calendars and works efficiently on any device – even touch screens. Our WordPress booking plugin will work dependably and reliably, whether you're managing your appointment availability from your tablet or your customer is booking an appointment from their smartphone.

= User-Friendly and Accessible Booking System =

Our WordPress booking calendar system was designed with people in mind, first and foremost. So we're always thinking about how people will be using our appointment scheduling plugin, what they'll expect, and what booking features they'll want and need.

This WordPress booking calendar system is built with you and your customer in mind and is accessible for everyone. We believe appointment scheduling should be as clear and straightforward as possible while maintaining the flexibility and booking features our customers need.

We've made sure that everyone can use our appointment scheduling plugin, including people with auditory, visual, and physical disabilities.

Everyone deserves access to everything the web offers, so we built our WordPress booking calendar plugin with accessibility in mind. As a result, you'll never have to worry that a customer will find themselves unable to schedule an appointment because of their abilities or the device they're using.

= Will I end up being double-booked? =

Nope. Once a customer has booked an appointment time, that time is no longer available for booking. So you'll never find yourself double-booked.

Additionally, we do some extra checks while a customer is booking an appointment just to be sure their selected time is still available. If someone else books their selected time while they're in the process of booking, we'll let them know and ask them to select another time.

We also offer [Google Calendar syncing in our Plus, Pro, or Business Edition](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/guides/syncing-google-calendar/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=google-calendar) to make sure you never double-book appointments with your personal schedule.

[You can additionally add custom CSS to customize the form even further](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/guides/helpful-customization-guides/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=css-customize).

= Are there limitations on the number of booking calendars or appointments I can make? =

No! The free Basic Edition of Simply Schedule Appointments allows you to create an unlimited number of Appointment Types so that you can create a booking calendar for each of your business' services.

And the booking plugin will never limit the number of appointments that you can book.

= Can I test the Simply Schedule Appointments booking calendars before installation? =
